# Summary report


We have made a functioning robot arm that can grab objects in a 360 angle. The arm is missing controllers for the servos (currently they are controlled by arduino using laptop). The arduino and the extra breadboard for all servos could have had a container for them.

Considering sustainability all the servos are attached by screws so they can be detached from the arm with a screwdriver.
