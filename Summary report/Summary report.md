# Summary report


We have made a functioning robot arm that can grab objects in a 360 angle. The arm is missing controllers for the servos (currently they are controlled by arduino using laptop). The arduino and the extra breadboard for all servos could have had a container for them. Also the servo cables can get in the way of the arm.

Considering sustainability all the servos are attached by screws so they can be detached from the arm with a screwdriver.
