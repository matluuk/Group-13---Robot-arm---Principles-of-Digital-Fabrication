# Week 17 report

Week 17 goals was to have a full team meetup on tuesday to get the prototype working without the claw part. We didn't have enough power for all servos throught arduino
so we got and soldered a cable for servos that uses laptop usb for power. Picture below.

Below a video of working robot arm (without the claw) using its arm to topple a cardboard piece

Errors and failures: the robot arm can get stuck within its own cables. We didnt try to resolve this problem yet because the prototype is not ready yet.

We were still missing the claw part and the code for the arm needed some fine tuning, which we did by the end of week 17.

The design for the extendable claw was heavily inspired by a youtube video https://youtu.be/IalkWUN6wvE

We made changes to claw design so servos can be attached
